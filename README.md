The pdf documents are originally retrieved from [here](http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2015/budgetarchives.aspx)
The pdf files were converted to text files using **PDF to Text** on Mac OS. One pdf file (FY2003) was a bit tricky, showing a big golden lock when imported to the tool, I used an online alternative from [here](http://convertonlinefree.com/PDFToTXTEN.aspx)
